# wordsearchsolver2
 I created a code that can solve word search puzzles by inputting the number of words and the words to 
be search by the program. The program only accepts positive integer number (excluding 0) for the number
of words and the program only accepts letters in the alphabet as its input in the words. If they are not sati
sfied, the program will repeteadly ask the user to input the number of words until the user inputs an accep
table input and it will proceed to the inputting of words and the same process will be done if the user inpu
ts a non-acceptable characters. After that it will make the words into uppercase letters and it will sort the in
put words alphabetically. Next, the program will ask the user to input how many rows does the word searc
h puzzle have(the condition on the number of words input is also applied on this part). It is always assume
d that the number of rows is equal to the number columns. So the user can input either the number of ro
ws or number of columns since they must be equal. After getting the number of rows, the program will ask
the user to input the letters in the word search puzzle row by row(the condition on word input is also appl
ied to this with additional condition that row input must contain the same number of letters as the number
of rows) Finally, the program will print the solutions by printing each word to be find then followed by thei
r starting coordinates in the direction of the words.
